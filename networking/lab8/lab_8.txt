1. Experiment 1 [5 marks]
In this assignment you will perform an experiment to understand the working
of the Spanning Tree Protocol. The Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) prevents
loops from being formed when switches or bridges are interconnected via
multiple paths. Switches exchange messages to detect loops, and then
removes the loop by blocking selected bridge interfaces. It guarantees that
there is one and only one active path between two network devices.
Consider the given network topology with five L2 switches. Edit the switch
priorities as per the given figure. For an example, B1 will get priority 1 and B2
will get priority 2 and so on.

H1 --- B1 ------------ B4 --- H3
        |\             | 
        | B3---------- B5 ----H4    
        |/
H2 --- B2



Create a custom application for source H2 to destination H4 with packet size
1000 bytes and inter-arrival time to 800 microsec. The start time parameter is
set to 1 sec while configuring the application. Run the simulation for 10 sec.

Designated Ports:

B2's port connecting to B1
B1's port connecting to B4
B4's port connecting to B5

Blocked Ports:

B3's port connecting to B1
B3's port connecting to B2
B3's port connecting to B5

2. Experiment 2 [5 Marks]

Design a network scenario using a Layer-2 Switch where devices (Wired Nodes
in NetSim) D1, D2 belong to VLAN1 and D3, D4 belong to VLAN2.
a. Create a broadcast application with D1 as the source. Document the frames
received on both the VLANs. [1 Mark]

VLAN 1 : 4987
VLAN 2 : 0 

b. Create a unicast application with D2 as the sender and D1 as the receiver.
Determine the throughput, and the number of packets received in error. [2
Marks]

throughput : .584
number of packets received in error : 6

c. Create a unicast application with D2 as the sender and D3 as the receiver.
Determine the throughput of the network. Document your
findings/observations. [2 Marks]

throughput : 0.00
number of packets transmitted : 5000
number of packets received : 0
Direct communication between devices on separate VLANs is not allowed without routing
